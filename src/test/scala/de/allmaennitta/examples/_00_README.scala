/**
  * These lessons are collected from various sources which are
  * - http://alvinalexander.com/scala/ => very helpful site to learn Scala
  * - "Android Learn Scala" - app which is basically a not so good ebook with ads
  * - https://github.com/bijukunjummen/spring-boot-scala-web/ for SpringBoot integration
  * - the official Scala- and Akka-Doku
  *
  * Please don't just rely on your IDE. Try also 'sbt' (Scala Build Tool) for example
  *
  * E.g. all tests can be executed by <sbt test>
  *
  * For single tests I recommend the commandline-function of sbt
  *
  * 1. Type just <sbt> to get the prompt
  * 2. Type <testOnly ibe.examples._03_If> for executing all if-related tests
  *
  * If you have sbt installed, you don't need a separate scala-installation, e.g. to get a scala console.
  * Just enter <sbt console>
  *
