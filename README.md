# myScalaTutorial
I discovered this beautiful language step by step writing unit tests for it. 
I hope others can do the same repeating, modifying and enriching these tests. 

In advance, thanks a lot to the creators of Scala and especially to Martin Odersky.
Please feel encouraged to read [his book about Scala](https://www.artima
.com/shop/programming_in_scala_3ed) or e.g. do his [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1).

For best results [install sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

My Test Cases are sourced by various pages and sources (of which many originate from Martin 
Odersky, as I realized.)

- http://alvinalexander.com/scala/ => very helpful site to learn Scala
- "Android Learn Scala" - app which is basically a not so good ebook with ads, better not support it
- https://github.com/bijukunjummen/spring-boot-scala-web/ for SpringBoot integration
- the official Scala- and Akka-Doku
